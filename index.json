Dominant heat exchange Buildings are often described as either envelope (skin) or internally loaded; these descriptions characterise the dominant heat exchange in the building.\nSkin load dominated means that internal gains are low relative to fabric heat transfers Internal load dominated means that internal gains are high relative to fabric heat transfers\nSo \u0026hellip;\n Skin load dominated = gains \u0026lt; losses  Internal load dominated = gains \u0026gt;= losses  Where:\n Gains = Internal gains + Solar gains Losses = Conduction + Fresh air + Infiltration  And where:\n Fresh air = Aux vent gain + Nat vent gain + Free cooling gain + MacroFlo ext vent gain  The method reports the sum over all occupied hours of the energy in each condition and the hours that each condition is dominant.\nSimilarly ventilation, casual, solar loads and how the building is used add detail and help in defining appropriate responses.\n2. Response limitations Critical use or night occupied buildings limit responses e.g. night purge ventilation, relaxed summer design set points etc.\n3. Ceiling heights Floor to ceiling heights of 3m or more promote stratification; with the right HVAC strategy this reduces cooling load. Ceiling heights lower than 3.5m can reduce HVAC system choice. Very tall spaces require special consideration\n4. Building form The overall form of the building can be a response to these characteristics and to the climate type; high surface area buildings lose heat faster and thus suit hot climates better than cold climates\n5. Cross ventilation Cross ventilation is more effective than single sided ventilation; cross ventilation can occur across the building plan form window to window, across corners, via windows and roof lights or chimneys. The importance of cross ventilation in naturally ventilated designs increases with higher occupancy, higher heat gains and as the climate becomes hotter. In hot and humid climates it is essential.\n6. Glazing For day lighting purposes glazing % (ext wall) is normally in the range of 15 - 40%; beyond 40% glare and solar gains are a problem. In hot climates lower than optimum glazing areas maybe chosen as heat gains are predominant\n"

If you wish to know more about ApacheSim and obtain a copy of the ANSI/ASHRAE 140 standard report then visit iesve.com\rReport format The energy report has the following features:\n Energy/CO2 summary Simulation history Analysis details Annual building energy use Carbon emissions Occupant comfort Peak room loads System loads Room heating loads Room cooling loads  Energy report\nNotes: Comfort  PPD is the Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied. This value represents the percentage of people that will find the room thermally uncomfortable. ASHRAE 55 states comfort lies between 5 and 10% PPD (US Only)  Room loads ASHRAE Loads provides the heating and cooling loads for the building and rooms using the ASHRAE 2005 Heat Balance Method. For each room, the method calculates the conductive, convective, and radiative heat balance for each surface and for the air.\n System loads represent the time of the peak coincident load on the system, not the sum of individual peak room loads. Positive values represent heat gains into a space (cooling operation), and negative values represent heat losses (heating operation). In climates with large diurnal temperature swings, thermal mass can provide a time lag in the heat transfer. Room loads are reported at the peak load condition for each room; each will experience peak gains at different times of the year and day depending on orientation, internal loads, etc. This method is used for peak load plant sizing, but excludes domestic hot water loads. For heating calculations it does not include solar or internal heat gains.  Other notes: Outside air ventilation is considered to be conditioned by the system so it is included in the system peak load, not the room peak load. The proportion of this load that each room is responsible for is reported, but not considered in the individual room peak loads.\nImproved insulation and shading coefficient can help address gains and losses. Tradeoffs between heat gains and daylight can help to optimize the quantity of external glazing.\n"

The review highlights the types of materials that are predominant in the project so that alternatives can be considered where possible Generally materials which are dense / heavy, materials that have been heavily processed and materials that have been transported long distances have high embodied energy\nAdditionally some materials contain or are manufactured using substances which are toxic. PVC is an often quoted example. Alternative materials should be of lower embodied energy, or when limited choice / option is available high embodied materials should be used as efficiently as possible; the use of concrete soffits (structural and fireproof) for thermal mass is a prime example.\nImpact The review also indicates the potential impact of waste in the construction process; typically 10% of construction materials are wasted during the construction process\nBetter design, on site waste management and on site recycling (typically this can reduce the waste to around 2%) could dramatically improve this with the following consequential benefits:\n Significant cost savings (material, labour, transport and disposal costs) Reduction of environmental impact Improved productivity and efficiencies on site Improved health and safety Competitive advantage  "
