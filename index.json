	"content": "Create and understand the building model\u0026rsquo;s geometry.\rGenerate/Import/Draw Geometry We can create Geometry in Gaia in a number of ways:\n Auto-Generate using Starter Geometry Import from BIM Draw in ModelIT  Auto-generate from Starter Geometry The Create From Starter Geometry sub-section can be used to create a new project that is either blank (i.e. no geometry) or containing pre-defined default building geometry. This offers a fast and intuitive way of creating early-stage geometry for projects with minimal pre-required configuration.\nThe Starter Geometry group consists of 17 thumbnails for the pre-defined geometry to create in the new project – only one of these thumbnails can be selected. The first option is None and is selected by default – this means no pre-defined geometry will be created in the new project. The other 16 thumbnails represent different building types (e.g. Small Office, Hospital, Restaurant), with the thumbnail image itself giving an indication of what the geometry will look like. Once the desired option in the Starter Geometry group has been clicked and the appropriate options selected for Location \u0026amp; Weather and HVAC Methodology, the project can be created using the selected options by clicking the Create Project button – this will close the Start Page and any existing opened project (you will be prompted to save the existing project if necessary) and the project will be created.\nCreate from BIM The Create From BIM File sub-section can be used to create a new project that includes geometry and/or data from a Building Information Model (BIM) file in gbXML, IFC or veXML format.\nThe BIM Options group allows the selection of a file to import, the type of import option to use, as well as options allowing for previewing of the BIM model using the VE Quarantine dialog prior to import and whether or not to display a log detailing any issues encountered when importing. By default, there is no BIM file selected – this is indicated by the group title displaying No BIM File Selected in red. It is not possible to create a project until a BIM file has been selected – clicking the Create Project button at the bottom of the sub-section will display a balloon tip to indicate this.\nTo select a BIM file, click on the Browse for BIM File… button. Once a file has been selected, it will display under the Browse for BIM File… button:\nIf the selected file is not a recognised format, a suitable message will be displayed in both the group and its title (again, it will not be possible to create a project until a different file is selected):\nOnce a valid file is selected, the Import Options and Other Options items below will be enabled for selection. There are 6 possible import options – choose the one that best suits your needs for the BIM file in question:\nThese options correspond to those available within the BIM Navigator and explanatory text is provided for each one – for further details, see the Choose Import Option [MM1] section of the BIM Navigator help. The Other Options section consists of two possible options – you can choose to use either, both or neither of these:\nIf the Preview the BIM Model before importing checkbox is ticked, the Quarantine window will be displayed prior to importing:\nThe Quarantine window will allow you to preview the geometry using ModelViewer, as well as perform checks and healing on the geometry prior to import. You can also choose to change the import option here if you need to. If the Preview the BIM Model before importing checkbox on the Start Page was unticked, the Quarantine window will not be displayed prior to importing, and geometry healing will be automatically applied. If the Display the Import Log after importing checkbox is ticked, the BIM import log will be automatically displayed when the importing of the BIM model is completed. The import log will highlight any issues with spaces and/or data in the model that you may need to review or be aware of before continuing with the project in the VE.\nThe Shell Import Preferences… button at the bottom-right of the Other Options settings allows you to access the Shell Import Preferences window directly from the Start Page – see the Shell Import Preferences[MM2] section for details on these settings.\nOnce a BIM File and import option has been selected in the BIM Options group and the appropriate options selected for Location \u0026amp; Weather and HVAC Methodology, the project can be created using the selected options by clicking the Create Project button – this will close the Start Page and any existing opened project (you will be prompted to save the existing project if necessary), the project will be created and the BIM model will be imported appropriately. Depending on the size of the BIM model and the option(s) selected, this may take some time to fully import.\nDrawing in the VE Spaces are created using the facilities Draw extruded shape, Draw prism, Draw pyramid, Draw sphere, Draw hemisphere and Draw cylinder. These facilities share a Shape Settings dialog which allows you to specify various attributes of the space.\nUnderstand the building characteristics and metrics Could pop a section description in here.\nSet building type We need to set the \u0026lsquo;Building Type\u0026rsquo; in order to generate metrics.\nCreate building metrics report This runs ApacheSim to perform an annual energy simulation on the building model.\n\r"

See also Koeppen Geiger and Kottek, Greiser,Beck, Rudolf and Rubel. Both the climate zone defined by ASHRAE and the climate zone calculated from the assigned weather data are displayed. The analysis in this report is based on the calculated climate zone.\nBioclimatic analysis is using an understanding of climate to inform building design strategy. The analysis is sensitive to the climate file used and especially sensitive to the rainfall data used - check!\nBioclimatic analysis is also a reasoned understanding of traditional or vernacular architecture and why it is so.\nArchitects find bioclimatic analysis useful as it can provide early directional substance to what form and grammar a building should take in order to respond to fundamental climatic demands.\nEngineers can use bioclimatic analysis to understand the demands climate imposes on a building and potentially long term climate change effects.\nBioclimatic analysis thus feeds directly into the conception phase of design.\nBioclimatic issues are diverse and complex; deriving appropriate responses can therefore prove difficult. This analysis therefore utilises user selected weather data to carry out an automated process and then report appropriate responses.\nIt should be noted that this analysis cannot know details of any specific site nor specific local details as it is based solely on weather data; it does however provide that often hard to define overall perspective.\nThe analysis provides a summary of climatic characteristics followed by a suggested list of built form responses starting at the macro scale and working down in scale through building form and details.\nThe suggested responses have most relevance on natural or passive designs, however they can also inform on designs that are to be more heavily serviced.\nThe user should also use the VE Climate report for weather/climate metrics in conjunction with this report.\nTo become familiar with the suggestions in this report we suggest looking at traditional architectural forms in their local environments in conjunction with an analysis \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; the user will be able to identify the suggestions manifested in physical form.\nExamples to try:\n The Alhambra Vernacular housing; Charleston, Malay, Yemen/Mexico (Adobe or Pueblo) Eco Houses generally FLW Cooperative Homesteads, Usonian housing, Larkin Building  Provided beside the suggestions are references for further reading including page numbers.

	"content": "Create and understand the building model\u0026rsquo;s geometry.\r1. Dominant heat exchange Buildings are often described as either envelope (skin) or internally loaded; these descriptions characterise the dominant heat exchange in the building.\nSkin load dominated means that internal gains are low relative to fabric heat transfers Internal load dominated means that internal gains are high relative to fabric heat transfers\nSo \u0026hellip;\n Skin load dominated = gains \u0026lt; losses  Internal load dominated = gains \u0026gt;= losses  Where:\n Gains = Internal gains + Solar gains Losses = Conduction + Fresh air + Infiltration  And where:\n Fresh air = Aux vent gain + Nat vent gain + Free cooling gain + MacroFlo ext vent gain  The method reports the sum over all occupied hours of the energy in each condition and the hours that each condition is dominant.\nSimilarly ventilation, casual, solar loads and how the building is used add detail and help in defining appropriate responses.\n2. Response limitations Critical use or night occupied buildings limit responses e.g. night purge ventilation, relaxed summer design set points etc.\n3. Ceiling heights Floor to ceiling heights of 3m or more promote stratification; with the right HVAC strategy this reduces cooling load. Ceiling heights lower than 3.5m can reduce HVAC system choice. Very tall spaces require special consideration\n4. Building form The overall form of the building can be a response to these characteristics and to the climate type; high surface area buildings lose heat faster and thus suit hot climates better than cold climates\n5. Cross ventilation Cross ventilation is more effective than single sided ventilation; cross ventilation can occur across the building plan form window to window, across corners, via windows and roof lights or chimneys. The importance of cross ventilation in naturally ventilated designs increases with higher occupancy, higher heat gains and as the climate becomes hotter. In hot and humid climates it is essential.\n6. Glazing For day lighting purposes glazing % (ext wall) is normally in the range of 15 - 40%; beyond 40% glare and solar gains are a problem. In hot climates lower than optimum glazing areas maybe chosen as heat gains are predominant\n"

The review highlights the types of materials that are predominant in the project so that alternatives can be considered where possible Generally materials which are dense / heavy, materials that have been heavily processed and materials that have been transported long distances have high embodied energy\nAdditionally some materials contain or are manufactured using substances which are toxic. PVC is an often quoted example Alternative materials should be of lower embodied energy, or when limited choice / option is available high embodied materials should be used as efficiently as possible; the use of concrete soffits (structural and fireproof) for thermal mass is a prime example\n2. The review also indicates the potential impact of waste in the construction process; typically 10% of construction materials are wasted during the construction process\nBetter design, on site waste management and on site recycling (typically this can reduce the waste to around 2%) could dramatically improve this with the following consequential benefits:\n Significant cost savings (material, labour, transport and disposal costs) Reduction of environmental impact Improved productivity and efficiencies on site Improved health and safety Competitive advantage  "
